# This repository is to support the completion of TBSS analyses for the ENIGMA-AN DTI working group

The aim of the TBSS analysis is to describe white matter alterations that are present among individuals with AN relative to healthy control peers (HC). This is possible via analysis of diffusion imaging data, which is sensitive to differences in the direction of water diffusion throughout the brain. When diffusion is more directed within white-matter tracts, it is assumed these tracts have better structural integrity. Where diffusion is more isotropic within white-matter (i.e., undirected) this can suggest poorer integrity of the brain tissue, potentially due to axonal degeneration or reduced myelination/axonal density. In this analysis we will estimate the direction of water flow in each voxel along a white matter skeleton. Average diffusion metrics (across voxels within 25 distinct regions of interest) will be calculated, and compared between individuals with AN and HC. The between-group analyses will generate a set of test statistics that will be combined across different sites in a meta-analysis, for large-scale comparison of white matter characteristics between individuals with AN and HC. 

The instructions outlined in the "Instructions" word document are intended to allow the different sites to complete the analyses and submit results for the meta-analysis, however the processing and analyses can be completed centrally if the data sharing agreements permit this.
